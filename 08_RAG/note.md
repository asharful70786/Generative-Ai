RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

It retrieves relevant data (from database, docs, PDFs, etc.) and feeds it to an LLM before generation.

The model then answers using your data, not just its own training or the internet.

Think of it like giving the LLM a custom memory or “open-book access” to your files.

Example: In a hospital, RAG can search SOPs and policies so staff get accurate, context-based answers.
